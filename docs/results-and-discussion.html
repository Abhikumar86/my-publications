<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Results and Discussion</h2>
<p>The results of the vote count approach from different databases have indicated the dominance of the term Siwalik and the distribution pattern of these terms is shown in Fig. 2. Each selected database depicted the same pattern i.e. the term ‘Siwalik’ was most dominant whereas the term ‗Sivalik’ was least represented. On the other hand, the terms ‗Shivalik’ and ‗Shiwalik’ were more or less equally represented. Further, the annual production of published articles in the Scopus and Web of Science database has revealed that the number of publications with term ‗Siwalik’ has exponentially increased, whereas it is only during the past two decades when the usage of the terms ‗Shivalik’ and ‗Shiwalik’ has become more frequent (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the analysis of Scopus and Web of Science database revealed that the term ‗Siwalik’ was the oldest term (1878) which has increased rapidly and continues to increase, but the term ‗Shivalik’ (1955) and ‗Shiwalik’ (1973) were relatively recent terms which are increasing only during the recent decades. Another term ‗Sivalik’ is also one of the oldest terms (1880) but the usage of this term has been diminished during the past decades (Fig. 3). However, a more extensive survey of available literature from other sources (Internet Archive and Biodiversity Heritage Library) suggested that the term ‗Sivalik’ was the oldest term and first appeared in 1836 (Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1836). Though the usage of the term ‗Siwalik’ can be traced from 1528 A. D. in memoirs of the Emperor Babar (Burrard &amp; Hayden, 1907), the term was first introduced to scientific literature in 1839 by Capt. P. T. Cautley (a palaeontologist) and Hugh Falconer (a geologist and botanist) of the East India Company, who surveyed the hills located near to the Haridwar a pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Shiva, therefore, the hills were termed as ―Siwalik hills‖ (Cautley, 1839; Sorkhabi, 2010). Similarly, the term ‗Shivalik’ seems to be first introduced by J. P. Campbell in 1879 while describing his observations on the Glacial period from India (Campbell, 1879) and this term seems to be second most frequently used term in modern literature. Further, the term ‗Shiwalik’ was first observed in 1963 while describing the Discomycetes fungi from the region (Batra &amp; Batra, 1963). Thus, the term ‗Sivalik’ was the oldest followed by ‗Siwalik’ and ‗Shivalik’ whereas the term ‗Shiwalik’ is the most recently used term. The dominance of the term ‗Siwalik’ may be due to its popularity, widespread use and is one of the oldest terms. All these terms are inspired by Lord Shiva, but it is the perception of author and subsequent translation into English which may have caused the observed variations in the spellings. Most of the early researchers who explored the area were non-native foreigners (from Britain, USA, etc.) and they named this hilly region according to their perception. That’s why the terms ‗Siwalik’ and ‗Sivalik’ were prevalent during the past century. However, the Indian authors have explored the region only during the past 4-5 decades, and they have introduced the terms ‗Shiwalik’ and ‗Shivalik’ referring to its correct translation. The origin of these terms across countries was evaluated by analysing the ten most frequent countries with the corresponding author in their publications with different terms. The distribution of these terms across countries is represented in Fig. 4. The variation of spellings of these terms is most commonly originates from India and therefore the publications from the country India are most diverse in the use of these terms. However, some countries like China, France, Germany, Nepal and Thailand have also used different spelling variants whereas other countries have used either of the spelling consistently. Since a large part of these foothills is shared by India; therefore, the country has the greatest number of publications mentioning these terms. The distribution of these terms across the top ten most relevant sources (like Journals, Books, etc.) is represented in Fig. 5 and these spelling variants were prevalent within some journals like Annals of Agri Bio Research, Current Science, Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences, Indian Journal of Ecology, Journal of Human Evolution, Nature and Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. But this variation is less prominent in the Web of Science as compared to Scopus (Fig. 5). It has been further observed that the term ‗Siwalik’ was most consistently used in the fields of Geosciences and related fields which is still in practice. On the other hand, almost all the terms were used interchangeably in agricultural and biological sciences or other fields. General information about bibliometric indicators of the publications with the terms from the Scopus and Web of Science database is presented in Table I.</p>
