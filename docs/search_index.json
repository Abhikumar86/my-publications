[["plant-ecology-in-indian-siwaliks.html", "2 Plant Ecology in Indian Siwaliks ", " 2 Plant Ecology in Indian Siwaliks "],["abstract-1.html", "2.1 Abstract", " 2.1 Abstract Conservation science and practice commonly draw on the theories and methods of social psychology to explain human cognition, emotion, and behaviour germane to biodiversity conservation. We created a systematic map of the cross-disciplinary conservation science literature, which draws on social psychology concepts and methods in their application broadly described as conservation psychology. Established protocols were used to systematically collect and collate peer-reviewed research published in an explicit selection of multidisciplinary conservation journals. We sought to catalogue the literature, elucidate trends and gaps, and critically reflect on the state of conservation psychology and its research practices that aim to influence conservation outcomes. The volume of publications per year and per decade increased from 1974 to 2016. Although a diversity of research designs and methods was applied, studies disproportionately focused on specific concepts (attitudes and beliefs), locations (North America and Europe), and contexts (terrestrial, rural). Studies also tended to be descriptive, quantitative, and a theoretical in nature. Our findings demonstrate that although conservation psychology has generally become more visible and prominent, it has done so within a limited space and suggest that disciplinary research principles and reporting standards must be more universally adopted by traditional and multidisciplinary conservation journals to raise the floor of empirical research. "],["introduction-1.html", "2.2 Introduction", " 2.2 Introduction The rate of anthropogenic biodiversity loss far exceeds the background rate of species extinctions. Global targets for biodiversity acknowledge this, nevertheless progress towards targets has been poor. There is now a reasonable understanding of what human pressures threaten the survival of species. However, information on where these threats are impacting species is needed to coordinate conservation actions and threat abatement efforts. Herein, threats are defined as human-driven pressures specifically where they co-occur with, and threaten the survival of, native wild species. There is a large number of studies that map either distributions of threatened species or human-driven pressures alone. This makes it difficult to identify research that has investigated the spatial distribution of the threats themselves. Additionally, the high variability in approaches taken in these studies promotes a high risk of duplication and diversity among the findings. This variation, and the lack of studies directly mapping threats, limits the utility of threat mapping studies for conservation planning and informing policy. Therefore, a systematic consolidation of the literature is necessary to identify where knowledge is lacking, and where sufficient evidence exists for synthesis of the collective findings. Understanding ecological structure and functions is vital for ensuring the sustainability of any ecosystem. Objective of the review Ecological studies Concern/Problem Ecology enriches our world and is crucial for human wellbeing and prosperity. It provides new knowledge of the interdependence between people and nature that is vital for food production, maintaining clean air and water, and sustaining biodiversity in a changing climate. There is a need to know the quantity and quality of research that has been conducted on a specific question. A descriptive overview is required of the evidence base for a given topic Systematic mapping provides a snapshot of the current state of knowledge, identifying areas needing more research attention and those ready for full synthesis. "],["objectives.html", "2.3 Objectives", " 2.3 Objectives This review aims to describe the focus of plant ecological studies by analysing the current evidence of existing studies. Further, we will identify the clusters and gaps in the current knowledge, which will guide the future investigations. Primary question: What evidence exists for research focusing on plant ecology in Indian Siwaliks? Population: The evidence base of studies focusing plant ecology in Indian Siwaliks. The taxonomic scope of this review is any plant species in the Siwaliks of north-west India. The siwalik region has been defined as the foothills of the Himalayas and spatially as defined by the Geological Survey of India (https://bhukosh.gsi.gov.in/Bhukosh/MapViewer.aspx). Outcome: The distribution of studies focusing plant ecology will be the outcome to be analysed. The studies to be included must have addressed any aspect of plant ecology. By Plant Ecology, we mean studies addressing distribution of plants, and interactions of plants with environment or other species. Thus, the studies must have plants as one of the components under study. However, this study will not focus on agroecological aspects, therefore studies focusing on agricultural systems will be beyond the scope of this review. Secondary questions What is the geographical distribution of the evidence? What is the temporal distribution of the evidence? Which domains of ecology are frequently studied? What are the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed? "],["methodology.html", "2.4 Methodology", " 2.4 Methodology We adopted the guidelines and recommendations established by Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) for evidence synthesis in environmental management (Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, 2018). These recommendations are designed to improve transparency and reproducibility of reviews in environmental contexts (Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, 2018; Grames &amp; Elphick, 2020). We departed from recommended practises as we neither consulted stakeholders nor registered a protocol. A review team comprising of individuals with relevant skills and knowledge (subject and methodological) was formed. The roles and responsibilities of each participant has been defined during the initial project development. We organised meetings and discussions at every weekend to develop the protocol, search strategy, screening, data extraction, analyses and writing. The selection of appropriate studies for the present review involved of three phases: searching, screening, and inclusion (Figure 2.1). Figure 2.1: Schematic flow diagram for literature search, screening and inclusion process (modified from Haddaway, Macura, Whaley, &amp; Pullin, 2018) 2.4.1 Literature database Scopus (https://scopus.com/) and Web of Science (https://webofknowledge.com/) are the most reliable databases for retrieval of high-quality peer-reviewed scientific literature in the fields of science and technology. Although the Web of Science Core Collection consists of seven indices: (i) Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), (ii) Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), (iii) Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (AHCI), (iv) Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), (v) Book Citation Index (BCI), (vi) Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI), and (vii) Current Chemical Reactions and Index Chemicus (https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science-core-collection/), our institution provided us access to SCIE, SSCI and AHCI for the timespan 1989-present. Both databases allow to export bibliographic meta-data offer great accuracy and reproducibility of literature search. However, access to these databases required a subscription through payment of large money. Although both databases emerged in 2004, Scopus offers relatively larger coverage of scientific literature whereas Web of Science provides offers coverage from early 1900. On the other hand, Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) is freely available and has most comprehensive coverage as it offers retrieval of most obscure information. Although it also provides access to full text articles, it is not a bibliographic database. Its content is dynamic and has compromised accuracy. Further, it lacks several functionalities in literature search like subject filtering and tagging. Considering these limitations, we limited our literature search to two bibliographic databases of peer-reviewed literature (Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus). 2.4.2 Search strings We identified the terms that are frequently applied to the region using a preliminary literature search and discussion with review team members (Table 2.1). Table 2.1: List of keywords used for developing search string group1 group2 group3 group4 shivalik himalayan foothills jammu hills dudhwa range sivalik outer himalayas kangra hills dundwa range shiwalik sub himalayas morni hills siwalik mohand hills Using a combination of these terms with boolean operators, we developed the following common search string for Web of Science and Scopus. (shivalik OR sivalik OR shiwalik OR siwalik) OR (himalaya* AND (foothill* OR outer OR sub)) OR (hill* AND (jammu OR kangra OR morni OR mohand)) OR (range* AND (dudhwa OR dundwa)) 2.4.3 Literature search Scopus: We have queried the above defined search string to the Article title, Abstract, Keywords in Documents using the default options for Limit (Date range (inclusive): Published from All years to Present; Document type: ALL). This query returned a total of 4,102 document results on 03 April 2021. Then, we have filtered the results by limiting subject to Agricultural and Biological Sciences and Environmental Science subject areas, which yielded a total of 1,875 documents. All these documents were selected by choosing Select All option and then exported all information by selecting Citation information, Bibliographical information, Abstract &amp; keywords, Funding details and Other information in the BibTex format. Web of Science Core Collection: The same keyword combination was queried in the Topic field of Web of Science by selecting the database Web of Science Core Collection. Default settings (Web of Science Core Collection: Citation Indexes - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) 1989-present, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) 1989-present, and Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI) 1989-present; Auto-suggest publication names: On; and Default Number of Search Fields to Display: 1 field (Topic)) were used under the more settings option. This yielded us 2,978 results on 03 April 2021. Then the results were refined by selecting following Web of Science categories: ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, PLANT SCIENCES, PALEONTOLOGY, ECOLOGY, BIOLOGY, REMOTE SENSING, SOIL SCIENCE, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, FORESTRY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, and ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES. This yielded a total of 1,013 results. Then the Show option was changed from 10 per page (Default) to 50 per page. Next, all entries on a page were first selected using the Select Page option and then added to Marked List using the Add to Marked List button. This was repeated for all the 21 pages and thus all the 1,103 entries were added to the Marked List. Since Web of Science allows export of 500 records at time, we have first selected the first 500 records by defining the record range Records: 1 to 500 under the Step 1: Select records. option. Then we have selected all the fields using the Select All option under Step 2: Select content. Select from the fields below: option. Next, we have exported the records in BibTex format using the Export option under the Step 3: Select destination. And then choosing the BibTex option under the Other File Formats. The same process was repeated for records 501 to 1,000 and 1,001 to 1,013. 2.4.4 Article screening We used the package revtools (Westgate, 2019) in R programming environment (R Core Team, 2021) for article screening phase. This phase included de-duplication, title screening, abstract screening and full text screening. For article screening phase, we adhered to the previously proposed eligibility criteria (Table 2.2). Table 2.2: Eligibility criteria for inclusion or exclusion of studies Criteria Inclusion articles falling in general scope of plant ecology study sites or their part situated within the boundary of Siwaliks studies involving plants as one of the component studies related to plant distributions and their interactions with environment studies involving ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and biomass production studies referring to palaeoecological studies such as fossil distribution and past vegetation Exclusion studies concerning animals, fungi, microbes or any organism other than plants studies focusing agroecosystems and agricultural practices studies related to ethnobotanical or traditional uses of plants studies evaluating phytochemicals or biological activities studies focusing cytology, genetics or molecular biology of plants studies reporting discovery of new species De-duplication: Database may have erroneous duplications or due to automated information extraction systems. Thus, the documents can be largely duplicated within and across literature databases. These duplicates might waste the energy and time of the reviewers apart from erroneous results of reviews. Therefore, removal of duplicates is necessary. Several procedures and software are available for automated de-duplication of literature. Here, we have first de-duplicated the documents based on doi (digital object identifier) of each articles. Then, we have de-duplicated by matching title of each article. However, the upper- or lower case and punctuations can interfere with title matching. Therefore, we converted titles to lower case and removed punctuations before matching. Thus, after de-duplication we are left with 2,171 (unique doi = 2,366, unique doi + unique title = 2,171) articles out of total 2,888 articles (Figure 2.1). After this, we have performed manual screening of duplicates, if remained any. Title screening: After de-duplication of articles, we performed article screening based on their titles. We have hidden every other information during title screening to avoid any potential bias. We assigned one of three labels to each article (i) selected, (ii) excluded, or (iii) unknown. We excluded 1,796 articles based on title screen and remaining 375 articles were selected for abstract screening out of which 158 articles were assigned selected and 217 articles were assigned unknown during the title screening. Next, we removed the articles assigned as excluded and screened for abstracts. Abstract screening: Our abstract screening resulted in exclusion of 264 articles and we are left with only 111 articles. Then we filtered these 111 articles and saved as the included articles (Figure 2.1). Then we searched for full text for every article from publishers website, Google Scholar, Research Gate and institutional repositories. We were not able to retrieve full text of following 11 articles. We excluded these 11 articles and screened full text of articles. Devi, B., Bhardwaj, D. R., Panwar, P., Pal, S., Gupta, N.

Indian Forester, 127, 12791286. Full text screening: For full text screening, we first selected five variables (label, title, journal, year and doi) from the included abstracts. Then, we manually screened articles based on the full text of every article. This process excluded 71 more articles and we left with only 40 studies (Figure 2.1). 2.4.5 Data extraction Considering the questions initially posed, we looked for the following information (if available) for each article: taxonomic group of plants under study (if available), to estimate taxonomic scope of studies geographic location (latitude and longitude) to estimate geographical distribution of studies. If it is not available in study, we estimate the approx location using Google Maps and Google Earth. We also recorded the Indian state in which study was conducted. year of the study to estimate temporal distribution of studies Domain of plant ecology for each the study. Adopting a single unique classification system for ecological studies is difficult as study areas often overlap. However, we adhered to the following broad classification system for the present study (Table 2.3). Table 2.3: Classification scheme for included studies Ecology domain Included topics Organismal ecology Population genetics, natural selection, behaviour Physiological ecology Adaptations to abiotic factors like temperature, light Population ecology Population growth, demography, age structure Species interactions Competition, facilitation, parasitism, symbiosis Community ecology Species diversity, succession, biogeography Ecosystem ecology Food web, biomass production, nutrient cycling, soil Palaeoecology Fossil records, palaeo-vegetation Landscape ecology Land use and land cover, ecological modelling, spatial and global ecology Applied ecology Conservation, management and restoration ecology Next, we manually extracted data from each of the 40 articles and assigned an ecological domain according the above classification system (Table 2.3). 2.4.6 Data analysis We developed a search string based on the doi (digital object identifier) and title (if doi is not available) of included studies to extract bibliometric metadata from the Scopus database. We retrieved bibliometric information for 39 articles on 09 May 2021. However, we were not able to extract metadata for an article because it was not available in Scopus; therefore, we excluded it from the final systematic map and narrative synthesis (Figure 2.1). This bibliometric data had several missing values (marked as NA), these values were manually added from the full text, if available. The bibliometric data analysis was conducted using the package bibliometrix (Aria &amp; Cuccurullo, 2017) in R programming environment (R Core Team, 2021). The bibliometric data was converted to a dataframe using the function convert2df() and saved for further analysis. The attributes of manuscript (e.g. title, authors, citations, keywords) are connected with manuscript itself, such connections can be represented as rectangular matrices (Manuscripts \\(\\times\\) Attributes). For example, consider a rectangular binary matrix \\(A\\), where rows represent the manuscripts and columns represent the authors. The generic element \\(A_{ij}\\) is 1 if the manuscript \\(i\\) has author \\(j\\) and 0 otherwise. The \\(j^{th}\\) column sum \\(A_j\\) is the number of manuscripts authored by author \\(j\\). This rectangular matrix represents as a bipartite network of Manuscripts \\(\\times\\) Authors (Aria &amp; Cuccurullo, 2017; Glänzel &amp; Schubert, 2005). The authors collaboration network was calculated by multiplying the bipartite matrix by its transpose (the same matrix flipped along its diagonal). \\[AC = A^T \\times A\\] where \\(A\\) is a bipartite network of Manuscripts \\(\\times\\) Authors and \\(A^T\\) is transpose of \\(A\\). The diagonal element \\(AC_i\\) is the number of manuscripts authored or co-authored by researcher \\(i\\). Authors collaboration network is useful for identifying the groups of researchers or teams as some authors are highly connected to each other. This is why scientific collaboration is frequently represented as the author collaboration networks (Glänzel &amp; Schubert, 2005). In a collaboration network of authors, each node (or vertex) represents an author and the edges between the nodes reflect the collaboration relationships among the authors. The weight of edge reflects the number of manuscripts in which the connected authors have appeared (i.e., the number of manuscripts authored by both researchers). Similarly, the keyword co-occurrence network was estimated from the bipartite network of Manuscripts \\(\\times\\) Keywords (Aria &amp; Cuccurullo, 2017). These keywords can be either provided by authors (Author Keywords) or chosen by database third parties (Indexed Keywords in Scopus and Keywords Plus in case of Web of Science). We considered Indexed Keywords for keyword co-occurrence because these are standardized by taking additional considerations such as synonyms, spelling variants and plurals.

After de-duplication and article screening, these records were reduced to 40 studies (Figure 2.1). However, only 39 studies were included in the final synthesis as bibliographic metadata was not available for a study (Figure 2.1). Thus, this synthesis is based on total 39 studies published in 26 sources (journals) during 1988 to 2021. The results of descriptive analysis of bibliometric indicators for selected studies are presented in Table 2.4.

Further, only nine journals had represented more than one study identified in this article (Figure 2.2). These nine journals (about 34.6%) represented about 56.4% of the total studies (n = 22) included. The maximum number of studies (n = 4) were published in International Journal of Remote Sensing (Figure 2.2). Figure 2.2: Publication sources (journals) representing at least two studies identified in the present article. The number of publications in a particular journal is represented in parenthesis Citations of an article usually related with its impact and influence on a specific research field. Highly cited articles are considered to have substantially contributed to the advancement of the field. The articles identified in this review exhibited about 20 citations per article at the average rate of about two citations per article per year (Table 2.4). The present analysis found that the article by Yang, Kushwaha, Saran, Xu, &amp; Roy (2013) had the highest citation (n = 236) in which they used maxent modelling to predict the distribution of Justicia adhatoda (Figure 2.3). Other highly cited articles with their respective citations are represented in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3: Most cited articles (with at least 25 citations) from idenitfied peer-reviewed publications A total of 368 indexed keywords and 160 authors keywords were identified from selected studies (Table 2.4). The connections among keywords were analysed using a keyword co-occurrence network of indexed keyword which revealed three distinct patterns about the research field (Figure 2.4). The keyword India and himalayas were most dominant as suggested by largest nodes (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.4: Co-occurrence network of indexed keywords (n = 25) from Scopus. The size of each vertex is proportional to its degree (i.e. the frequency of keywords) Our study identified a total of 111 distinct authors (Table 2.4). An analysis of the authors collaboration network suggested that authors form five distinct research groups working in different domains of plant ecology (Figure 2.5). The largest node for author padalia h suggests that this researcher is highly productive and has published highest number of documents. Further, high weight of edges among the authors padalia h, nandy s, chauhan p and srinet r manifests that these authors frequently appear together i.e., they work as a team (Figure 2.5). Figure 2.5: Collaboration network of authors (n = 25) from the selected studies. The size of each vertex is proportional to its degree (i.e. the frequency of authors appearance) 2.5.1 Geographical distribution of the studies The distribution of estimated study sites is depicted in Figure 2.6. The spatial distribution of studies suggest a high density around Uttarakhand state followed by Haryana (Figure 2.6). Our selected studies represented three states (Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Uttarakhand) and two union territories (Jammu and Kashmir and Chandigarh) of India (excluding studies conducted in multiple regions or whole region) and only five studies covered the whole region. Among the geographical regions, about 59% of total studies were featured from the Uttarakhand (n = 23) only (Figure 2.6). On the other hand, not a single study was identified from the Siwalik region of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Figure 2.6: Geographic distribution of the study sites (reported or estimated from publications) across the study region (JK = Jammu and Kashmir, HP = Himachal Pradesh, CH = Chandigarh, HR = Haryana, UK = Uttarakhand). The number of studies per region is indicated in parenthesis 2.5.2 Temporal distribution of studies The number of publications has shown an overall increasing trend and exhibited an annual growth rate of about 4.3% (Figure 2.7). During 2010s annual production of scientific publications observed a steep rise and the year 2020 recorded highest number of publications (n = 6) within a single year (Figure 2.7). Further, the decadal frequency of publications was six during 1990s, which dipped to only two publication per decade during 2000s. However, it so steeply increased during 2010s that it became double of all studies published from 1980s to 2000s (Figure 2.7). Figure 2.7: Annual frequency of scientific publications included in this synthesis. The trend line is fitted using 80% LOESS (y ~ x) smoothening. Inset shows the decadal frequency of publications 2.5.3 Domains of ecology We found three distinct study types, six distinct study region and seven distinct domains of plant ecology (Figure 2.8). Among the selected 39 studies, experimental studies were under-represented, accounting for just about 5% of total studies. On the other hand, observational and modelling studies were heavily dominated constituting about 95% of all the studies (Figure 2.8). Figure 2.8: Breakdown of selected studies by study type (EX = experimental, MO = modelling, OB = observational), region (CH = Chandigarh, HR = Haryana, HP = Himachal Pradesh, JK = Jammu and Kashmir, UK = Uttarakhand, WR = whole region) and domains of ecology (AE = applied ecology, CE = community ecology, EE = ecosystem ecology, LE = landscape ecology, PL = palaeoecology, PE = physiological ecology, SI = species interactions). The number of publications within each category is indicated in parenthesis We identified seven distinct (not mutually exclusive) domains under plant ecology (Figure 2.8). Among these assigned domains, about 38.5% studies belonged to landscape ecology and 30.77% studies belonged to ecosystem ecology; thus, together constituting about 70% of total studies (Figure 2.8).
