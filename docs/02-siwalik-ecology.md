# Plant Ecology in Indian Siwaliks



## Abstract

Conservation science and practice commonly draw on the theories and methods of
social psychology to explain human cognition, emotion, and behaviour germane to
biodiversity conservation. We created a systematic map of the cross-disciplinary
conservation science literature, which draws on social psychology concepts and
methods in their application broadly described as conservation psychology.
Established protocols were used to systematically collect and collate
peer-reviewed research published in an explicit selection of multidisciplinary
conservation journals. We sought to catalogue the literature, elucidate trends
and gaps, and critically reflect on the state of conservation psychology and its
research practices that aim to influence conservation outcomes. The volume of
publications per year and per decade increased from 1974 to 2016. Although a
diversity of research designs and methods was applied, studies
disproportionately focused on specific concepts (attitudes and beliefs),
locations (North America and Europe), and contexts (terrestrial, rural). Studies
also tended to be descriptive, quantitative, and a theoretical in nature. Our
findings demonstrate that although conservation psychology has generally become
more visible and prominent, it has done so within a limited space and suggest
that disciplinary research principles and reporting standards must be more
universally adopted by traditional and multidisciplinary conservation journals
to raise the floor of empirical research.

## Introduction

The rate of anthropogenic biodiversity loss far exceeds the background rate of
species extinctions. Global targets for biodiversity acknowledge this,
nevertheless progress towards targets has been poor. There is now a reasonable
understanding of what human pressures threaten the survival of species. However,
information on where these threats are impacting species is needed to coordinate
conservation actions and threat abatement efforts. Herein, threats are defined
as human-driven pressures specifically where they co-occur with, and threaten
the survival of, native wild species. There is a large number of studies that
map either distributions of threatened species or human-driven pressures alone.
This makes it difficult to identify research that has investigated the spatial
distribution of the threats themselves. Additionally, the high variability in
approaches taken in these studies promotes a high risk of duplication and
diversity among the findings. This variation, and the lack of studies directly
mapping threats, limits the utility of threat mapping studies for conservation
planning and informing policy. Therefore, a systematic consolidation of the
literature is necessary to identify where knowledge is lacking, and where
sufficient evidence exists for synthesis of the collective findings.
Understanding ecological structure and functions is vital for ensuring the
sustainability of any ecosystem. Objective of the review Ecological studies
Concern/Problem Ecology enriches our world and is crucial for human wellbeing
and prosperity. It provides new knowledge of the interdependence between people
and nature that is vital for food production, maintaining clean air and water,
and sustaining biodiversity in a changing climate. There is a need to know the
quantity and quality of research that has been conducted on a specific question.
A descriptive overview is required of the evidence base for a given topic

Systematic mapping provides a snapshot of the current state of knowledge,
identifying areas needing more research attention and those ready for full
synthesis.

## Objectives

This review aims to describe the focus of plant ecological studies by analysing
the current evidence of existing studies. Further, we will identify the clusters
and gaps in the current knowledge, which will guide the future investigations.

-   **Primary question:** What evidence exists for research focusing on plant
    ecology in Indian Siwaliks?

    -   **Population:** The evidence base of studies focusing plant ecology in
        Indian Siwaliks. The taxonomic scope of this review is any plant species
        in the Siwaliks of north-west India. The siwalik region has been defined
        as the foothills of the Himalayas and spatially as defined by the
        Geological Survey of India
        (<https://bhukosh.gsi.gov.in/Bhukosh/MapViewer.aspx>).
    -   **Outcome:** The distribution of studies focusing plant ecology will be
        the outcome to be analysed. The studies to be included must have
        addressed any aspect of plant ecology. By Plant Ecology, we mean studies
        addressing distribution of plants, and interactions of plants with
        environment or other species. Thus, the studies must have plants as one
        of the components under study. However, this study will not focus on
        agroecological aspects, therefore studies focusing on agricultural
        systems will be beyond the scope of this review.

-   **Secondary questions**

    -   What is the geographical distribution of the evidence?
    -   What is the temporal distribution of the evidence?
    -   Which domains of ecology are frequently studied?
    -   What are the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed?

## Methodology

We adopted the guidelines and recommendations established by Collaboration for
Environmental Evidence (CEE) for evidence synthesis in environmental management
[@CEE2018]. These recommendations are designed to improve transparency and
reproducibility of reviews in environmental contexts [@CEE2018; @grames2020]. We
departed from recommended practises as we neither consulted stakeholders nor
registered a protocol. A review team comprising of individuals with relevant
skills and knowledge (subject and methodological) was formed. The roles and
responsibilities of each participant has been defined during the initial project
development. We organised meetings and discussions at every weekend to develop
the protocol, search strategy, screening, data extraction, analyses and writing.
The selection of appropriate studies for the present review involved of three
phases: searching, screening, and inclusion (Figure \@ref(fig:fig21)).

### Literature database

Scopus (<https://scopus.com/>) and Web of Science
(<https://webofknowledge.com/>) are the most reliable databases for retrieval of
high-quality peer-reviewed scientific literature in the fields of science and
technology. Although the Web of Science Core Collection consists of seven
indices: (i) Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), (ii) Social Sciences
Citation Index (SSCI), (iii) Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI), (iv)
Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), (v) Book Citation Index (BCI),
(vi) Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI), and (vii) Current Chemical
Reactions and Index Chemicus
(<https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science-core-collection/>),
our institution provided us access to SCIE, SSCI and AHCI for the timespan
1989-present. Both databases allow to export bibliographic meta-data offer great
accuracy and reproducibility of literature search. However, access to these
databases required a subscription through payment of large money. Although both
databases emerged in 2004, Scopus offers relatively larger coverage of
scientific literature whereas Web of Science provides offers coverage from early
1900.

On the other hand, Google Scholar (<https://scholar.google.com/>) is freely
available and has most comprehensive coverage as it offers retrieval of most
obscure information. Although it also provides access to full text articles, it
is not a bibliographic database. Its content is dynamic and has compromised
accuracy. Further, it lacks several functionalities in literature search like
subject filtering and tagging. Considering these limitations, we limited our
literature search to two bibliographic databases of peer-reviewed literature
([Web of Science Core Collection](https://webofknowledge.com/) and
[Scopus](https://scopus.com/)).

### Search strings

We identified the terms that are frequently applied to the region using a
preliminary literature search and discussion with review team members 
(Table \@ref(tab:kw21)). 

<table>
<caption>(\#tab:kw21)List of keywords used for developing search string</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;color: #fff !important;background-color: #666 !important;"> group1 </th>
   <th style="text-align:left;color: #fff !important;background-color: #666 !important;"> group2 </th>

<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> shivalik </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> himalayan foothills </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> jammu hills </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> dudhwa range </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> sivalik </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> outer himalayas </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> kangra hills </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> dundwa range </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> shiwalik </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> sub himalayas </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> morni hills </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;">  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> siwalik </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;">  </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> mohand hills </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;">  </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Using a combination of these terms with boolean operators, 
we developed the following common search string for 
[Web of Science](https://webofknowledge.com/) and [Scopus](https://scopus.com/).

> (shivalik OR sivalik OR shiwalik OR siwalik) OR (himalaya\* AND (foothill\* OR
> outer OR sub)) OR (hill\* AND (jammu OR kangra OR morni OR mohand)) OR
> (range\* AND (dudhwa OR dundwa))

### Literature search

[Scopus](https://scopus.com/): We have queried the above defined search
    string to the "Article title, Abstract, Keywords" in "Documents" using the
    default options for "Limit" (Date range (inclusive): Published from "All
    years" to "Present"; Document type: "ALL"). This query returned a total of
    4,102 document results on 03 April 2021. Then, we have filtered the results
    by limiting subject to "Agricultural and Biological Sciences" and
    "Environmental Science" subject areas, which yielded a total of 1,875
    documents. All these documents were selected by choosing "Select All" option
    and then exported all information by selecting "Citation information",
    "Bibliographical information", "Abstract & keywords", "Funding details" and
    "Other information" in the BibTex format.

[Web of Science Core Collection](https://webofknowledge.com/): The same
    keyword combination was queried in the "Topic" field of Web of Science by
    selecting the database "Web of Science Core Collection". Default settings
    (Web of Science Core Collection: Citation Indexes - Science Citation Index
    Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) --1989-present, Social Sciences Citation Index
    (SSCI) --1989-present, and Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI)
    --1989-present; Auto-suggest publication names: On; and Default Number of
    Search Fields to Display: 1 field (Topic)) were used under the more settings
    option. This yielded us 2,978 results on 03 April 2021. Then the results
    were refined by selecting following Web of Science categories: ENVIRONMENTAL
    SCIENCES, PLANT SCIENCES, PALEONTOLOGY, ECOLOGY, BIOLOGY, REMOTE SENSING,
    SOIL SCIENCE, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, FORESTRY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, and
    ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES. This yielded a total of 1,013 results. Then the
    "Show" option was changed from "10 per page" (Default) to "50 per page".
    Next, all entries on a page were first selected using the "Select Page"
    option and then added to "Marked List" using the "Add to Marked List"
    button. This was repeated for all the 21 pages and thus all the 1,103
    entries were added to the "Marked List". Since Web of Science allows export
    of 500 records at time, we have first selected the first 500 records by
    defining the record range "Records: 1 to 500" under the "Step 1: Select
    records." option. Then we have selected all the fields using the "Select
    All" option under "Step 2: Select content. Select from the fields below:"
    option. Next, we have exported the records in BibTex format using the
    "Export" option under the "Step 3: Select destination." And then choosing
    the "BibTex" option under the "Other File Formats". The same process was
    repeated for records 501 to 1,000 and 1,001 to 1,013.

### Article screening

We used the package *revtools* [@westgate2019] in R programming environment [@R-base]
for article screening phase. This phase included de-duplication, title screening,
abstract screening and full text screening. For article screening phase, we adhered 
to the previously proposed eligibility criteria (Table \@ref(tab:ec22)).

**De-duplication**: Database may have erroneous duplications or due to automated information
extraction systems. Thus, the documents can be largely duplicated within and
across literature databases. These duplicates might waste the energy and time of
the reviewers apart from erroneous results of reviews. Therefore, removal of
duplicates is necessary. Several procedures and software are available for
automated de-duplication of literature. Here, we have first de-duplicated the
documents based on doi (digital object identifier) of each articles. Then, we
have de-duplicated by matching title of each article. However, the upper- or
lower case and punctuations can interfere with title matching. Therefore, we
converted titles to lower case and removed punctuations before matching. Thus,
after de-duplication we are left with 2,171 (unique doi = 2,366, unique doi +
unique title = 2,171) articles out of total 2,888 articles (Figure \@ref(fig:fig21)). 
After this, we have performed manual screening of duplicates, if remained any.



**Title screening**: After de-duplication of articles, we performed 
article screening based on their titles. We have hidden every other information 
during title screening to avoid any potential bias. We assigned one of three labels 
to each article (i) *selected*, (ii) *excluded*, or (iii) *unknown*. We excluded 
1,796 articles based on title screen and remaining 375 articles were
selected for abstract screening out of which 158 articles were assigned
"selected" and 217 articles were assigned "unknown" during the title screening. 
Next, we removed the articles assigned as "excluded" and screened for abstracts.



**Abstract screening**: Our abstract screening resulted in exclusion of 264 articles and 
we are left with only 111 articles. Then we filtered these 111 articles and saved as the 
included articles (Figure \@ref(fig:fig21)). Then we searched for full text for 
every article from publisher's website,
Google Scholar, Research Gate and institutional repositories. We were not able
to retrieve full text of following 11 articles. We excluded these 11 articles and 
screened full text of articles.

**Full text screening**: For full text screening, we first selected five variables 
(`label`, `title`, `journal`, `year`  and `doi`) from the included abstracts. 
Then, we manually  screened articles based on the full text of every article. 
This process excluded 71 more articles and we left with only 40 studies 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig21)).

### Data extraction

Considering the questions initially posed, we looked for the following
information (if available) for each article:

-   taxonomic group of plants under study (if available), to estimate taxonomic scope of studies
-   geographic location (latitude and longitude) to estimate geographical
    distribution of studies. If it is not available in study, we estimate the
    approx location using Google Maps and Google Earth. We also recorded the
    Indian state in which study was conducted.
-   year of the study to estimate temporal distribution of studies
-   Domain of plant ecology for each the study. Adopting a single
    unique classification system for ecological studies is difficult as study
    areas often overlap. However, we adhered to the following broad classification
    system for the present study (Table \@ref(tab:clasf23)).

<table>
<caption>(\#tab:clasf23)Classification scheme for included studies</caption>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Applied ecology </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Conservation, management and restoration ecology </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Next, we manually extracted data from each of the 40 articles and assigned an
ecological domain according the above classification system (Table
\@ref(tab:clasf23)).



### Data analysis

We developed a search string based on the doi (digital object identifier) and 
title (if doi is not available) of included studies to  extract bibliometric metadata from the 
Scopus database. We retrieved bibliometric information for 39 articles on 09 May 2021.
However, we were not able to extract metadata for an article because it was not available 
in Scopus; therefore, we excluded it from the final systematic map and narrative 
synthesis (Figure \@ref(fig:fig21)). This bibliometric data had several missing 
values (marked as `NA`), these values were manually added from the full text, if 
available.

The bibliometric data analysis was conducted using the package *bibliometrix*
[@bibliometrix2017] in R programming environment [@R-base]. The bibliometric data 
was converted to a dataframe using the function `convert2df()` and saved for 
further analysis. The attributes of manuscript (e.g. title, authors, citations, 
keywords) are connected with manuscript itself, such connections can be 
represented as rectangular matrices (Manuscripts $\times$ Attributes). For example, 
consider a rectangular binary matrix $A$, where rows represent the manuscripts 
and columns represent the authors. The generic element $A_{ij}$ is 1 if the 
manuscript $i$ has author $j$ and 0 otherwise. The $j^{th}$ column sum $A_j$ is 
the number of manuscripts authored by author $j$. This rectangular matrix 
represents as a bipartite network of Manuscripts $\times$ Authors 
[@bibliometrix2017; @glanzel2005]. The authors' collaboration network was calculated 
by multiplying the bipartite matrix by its transpose (the same matrix flipped 
along its diagonal).

$$AC = A^T \times A$$

where $A$ is a bipartite network of Manuscripts $\times$ Authors and $A^T$ is 
transpose of $A$. The diagonal element $AC_i$ is the number of manuscripts 
authored or co-authored by researcher $i$. 

Authors' collaboration network is useful for identifying the groups of researchers 
or teams as some authors are highly connected to each other. This is why scientific 
collaboration is frequently represented as the author collaboration networks 
[@glanzel2005]. In a collaboration network of authors, each node (or vertex) 
represents an author and the edges between the nodes reflect the collaboration 
relationships among the authors. The weight of edge reflects the number of 
manuscripts in which the connected authors have appeared (i.e., the number of 
manuscripts authored by both researchers).

Similarly, the keyword co-occurrence network was estimated from the bipartite 
network of Manuscripts $\times$ Keywords [@bibliometrix2017]. These keywords can 
be either provided by authors (Author Keywords) or chosen by database third parties 
(Indexed Keywords in Scopus and Keywords Plus in case of Web of Science). We considered
'Indexed Keywords' for keyword co-occurrence because these are standardized by 
taking additional considerations such as synonyms, spelling variants and plurals.




## Results

Our systematic literature search yielded total 2,888 documents from both Scopus 
and Web of Science Core Collection. After de-duplication and article screening, 
these records were reduced to 40 studies (Figure \@ref(fig:fig21)). However, only 
39 studies were included in the final synthesis as bibliographic metadata was not 
available for a study (Figure \@ref(fig:fig21)). Thus, this synthesis is based on 
total 39 studies published in 26 sources (journals) during 1988 to 2021. The results
of descriptive analysis of bibliometric indicators for selected studies are presented
in Table \@ref(tab:gendesc24).

The studies identified for the present review were published in 26 different 
journals. Further, only nine journals had represented more than one study 
identified in this article (Figure \@ref(fig:2-journals)). These nine journals
(about 34.6%) represented about 56.4% of the total studies (n = 22) included. The
maximum number of studies (n = 4) were published in 
'International Journal of Remote Sensing' (Figure \@ref(fig:2-journals)).

Citations of an article usually related with its impact and influence on a specific
research field. Highly cited articles are considered to have substantially contributed
to the advancement of the field. The articles identified in this review exhibited
about 20 citations per article at the average rate of about two citations per article
per year (Table \@ref(tab:gendesc24)). The present analysis found that the article 
by @yang2013 had the highest citation (n = 236) in which they used maxent modelling 
to predict the distribution of *Justicia adhatoda* (Figure \@ref(fig:2-citation)). 
Other highly cited articles with their respective citations are represented in 
Figure \@ref(fig:2-citation).

A total of 368 'indexed keywords' and 160 'author's keywords' were identified from 
selected studies (Table \@ref(tab:gendesc24)). The connections among keywords were 
analysed using a keyword co-occurrence network of 'indexed keyword' which revealed 
three distinct patterns about the research field (Figure \@ref(fig:2-keyocc)). The
keyword 'India' and 'himalayas' were most dominant as suggested by largest nodes
(Figure \@ref(fig:2-keyocc)).

Our study identified a total of 111 distinct authors (Table \@ref(tab:gendesc24)).
An analysis of the authors' collaboration network suggested that authors form 
five distinct research groups working in different domains of plant ecology 
(Figure \@ref(fig:2-authcol)). The largest node for author 'padalia h' suggests 
that this researcher is highly productive and has published highest number of 
documents. Further, high weight of edges among the authors 'padalia h', 'nandy s', 
'chauhan p' and 'srinet r' manifests that these authors frequently appear together
i.e., they work as a team (Figure \@ref(fig:2-authcol)).

### Geographical distribution of the studies

The distribution of estimated study sites is depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:2-map).
The spatial distribution of studies suggest a high density around Uttarakhand state
followed by Haryana (Figure \@ref(fig:2-map)).
Our selected studies represented three states (Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and 
Uttarakhand) and two union territories (Jammu and Kashmir and Chandigarh) of India 
(excluding studies conducted in multiple regions or whole region) and only five studies
covered the whole region. Among the geographical regions, about 59% of total studies 
were featured from the Uttarakhand (n = 23) only (Figure \@ref(fig:2-map)). On the
other hand, not a single study was identified from the Siwalik region of Punjab 
and Uttar Pradesh.

### Temporal distribution of studies

The number of publications has shown an overall increasing trend and exhibited 
an annual growth rate of about 4.3% (Figure \@ref(fig:temp23)). During 2010s 
annual production of scientific publications observed a steep rise and the year 
2020 recorded highest number of publications (n = 6) within a single year 
(Figure \@ref(fig:temp23)). Further, the decadal frequency of publications was six
during 1990s, which dipped to only two publication per decade during 2000s. However,
it so steeply increased during 2010s that it became double of all studies published 
from 1980s to 2000s (Figure \@ref(fig:temp23)).

### Domains of ecology

We found three distinct study types, six distinct study region and seven distinct 
domains of plant ecology (Figure \@ref(fig:2-stype)). Among the selected 39 studies, 
experimental studies were under-represented, accounting for just about 5% of total 
studies. On the other hand, observational and modelling studies were heavily dominated 
constituting about 95% of all the studies (Figure \@ref(fig:2-stype)).

The number of publications within each category is indicated in parenthesis</p>
</div>

We identified seven distinct (not mutually exclusive) domains under plant ecology 
(Figure \@ref(fig:2-stype)). Among these assigned domains, about 38.5% studies 
belonged to landscape ecology and 30.77% studies belonged to ecosystem ecology; 
thus, together constituting about 70% of total studies (Figure \@ref(fig:2-stype)).
